# breeze-chms

The `breeze-chms` javascript library provides convenient access to the [Breeze REST API](https://app.breezechms.com/api) from applications written in server-side JavaScript (Node).

> **Disclaimer**: API wrappers are not necessarily created or maintained by Breeze.

## Installation

Install the package with:

```sh
npm install breeze-chms --save
# or
yarn add breeze-chms
```

## Usage

This package supports both ESM and CommonJS imports.

### ESM (recommended)

```js
// Static import
import Breeze from 'breeze-chms';

// Dynamic import
const { default: Breeze } = await import('breeze-chms');
```

### CommonJS

```js
// require syntax
const Breeze = require('breeze-chms');
```

> This package uses TypeScript and comes fully typed, providing code-hinting via Intellisense. If you're not familiar with TypeScript—[get started today](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)!

### TypeScript Configuration

When using TypeScript, ensure your `tsconfig.json` has appropriate module resolution:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "moduleResolution": "node16", // or "bundler" for newer versions
    "module": "node16" // or "CommonJS" if using require
  }
}
```

The package needs to be configured with your account's subdomain and secret API key. The subdomain is what comes before `breezechms.com` in your browser address bar. Your unique/secret API key is available on the `Extensions` page of your Breeze account `https://YOURSUBDOMAIN.breezechms.com/extensions/api`. Require the package and initialize it with values for your subdomain and API key.

> **NOTE**: DO NOT hardcode, expose, or otherwise commit your API key to a repository.

This package is pure ESM. It must be `import`ed rather than `require`d and `async`/`await`:

```js
import Breeze from 'breeze-chms';
const breeze = new Breeze('SUBDOMAIN', 'APIKEY');

(async () => {
  const person = await breeze.people.get('PERSONID');
  console.log(person.id);
})();
```

## Endpoints

## Contributing

Feel free to open a pull-request with any changes if you'd like to help out! To develop locally, go through these few steps to get up and running:

```sh
> git clone https://github.com/Notebird-App/breeze-chms
> cd breeze-chms
> npm install
```

Next, you'll need to add a `.env` file to the root directory that looks something like this (replacing the values with your own, of course):

```
subdomain=YOURSUBDOMAIN
key=YOURAPIKEY
```

This let's you properly run the tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). However, they might fail at first because they rely on a couple custom profile fields to be present in your account. So you can add `Anniversary`, `Date joined`, `Service`, and `Room Number` in your Breeze account as custom text fields. _(You can remove these later if you wish)_
